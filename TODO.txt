Write about the new algorithms in algorithm design.

Add another section below explaining how these algorithms could work in real life and how the simulation is different.
Include how the algorithms might fail and how this could be handled in real life.

Expand on Background and related work with the grouping algorithm and possibly more?
Write about the partical algorithm and how it inspired the PI algorithm

Extend the Methods of analyzing the algorithms sections
Add the new results to Experiments and results and compare them

Do discussion and conclusion (maybe together)
Abstract

Fix formation 4 image
