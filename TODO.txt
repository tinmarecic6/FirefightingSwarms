Write about the new algorithms in algorithm design.

Add another section below explaining how these algorithms could work in real life and how the simulation is different.
Include how the algorithms might fail and how this could be handled in real life.


Extend the Methods of analyzing the algorithms sections
Add the new results to Experiments and results and compare them

Do discussion and conclusion (maybe together)
Abstract

Discuss the results and the reasons for such numbers
